# SDS 383D Statistical Modeling II

This course is a PhD-level course on statistical modeling, focusing on a hierarchical Bayesian framework, at The University of Texas at Austin, [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/), Spring 2018.

My name is Natalia Zuniga-Garcia. I'm a Ph.D. Student in [Transportation Engineering](http://caee.utexas.edu/research/specialities/trans) in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering. 

This is my personal page, where I submit the assignments and projects.

### About the course

The goal of the course is to develop the mathematical tools and intuition required to develop and deploy sophisticated Bayesian models. Major topics covered will be the multivariate normal distribution, hierarchical regression models, and latent variable models. 

The course will be run along the lines of [Moore's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_method), with much of the in-class time spent with students explaining and exploring the concepts covered. While I will spend some time giving traditional lectures, much of the learning will be guided by you, the student. Outside of class, you will work on exercises which we will then discuss and explore in class, allowing everyone to come to a deep understanding of the material.
