# Comments for the Peer-Reviewer

- We are still working on this exercise in class.

- The solution is presented in a [R-Markdown](Section_4.Rmd) file. I added its HTML output in [Section_4.html](Section_4.html). GitHub can not read directly the file so you may have to download and open it in your web browser. I also added a PDF version in  [Section_4.pdf](Section_4.pdf) if you only want a quick view. The document presents a detailed description of the solution for each exercise, and it also includes the description of the code I used.

- The R code files used is in this folder: [Section4R](Section4R).

- I also included a [Literature](Literature) folder, which contains additional readings I used.
